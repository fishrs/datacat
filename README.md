# Fishing Data Viewer GUI

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing and managing fishing data stored in `.fson` files.

Using cutting edge technology we have developed the brand new `.fson` file format.. that's literally just json but with an f for fish :)

## fson: Fishing Stuff Object Notation!

With our embedded fishing pole, the primary data being collected at a constant interval is in the following format(also found [here](https://github.com/fishrs/datafmt)):

```json
{
  "coords": {
    "lon": 0.0,
    "lat": 0.0
  },
  "pull": 0.0,
  "label": null
}
```

Where `pull` is the raw signal read from our strain sensor and `label` is currently whether a fish was on the line or not(null for unlabeled). On the raspberry Pi firmware we're using, this data will be continuously collected every few milliseconds. All of the data collected in the field needs to be labeled by hand, so a GUI tool to simplify the process seemed like the obvious choice.

## Features

- Load `.fson` files containing fishing data.
- Display loaded data in a scrollable list with options to label each entry as fish or no fish.
- Calculate and display the average pull of selected entries.
- Save labeled data back to the original `.fson` file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)

## Running

To run this GUI, simply cd into the root directory and run 

```
python3 main.py
```

It's that easy, now get out there and start labeling fish data ðŸ¦¾

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Click on "Load .fson File" to select and load a `.fson` file.
2. **View Data**: Loaded data is displayed in a list with details including longitude, latitude, pull, and current label status.
3. **Label Entries**: Select one or more entries and click either "FISH" or "NO FISH" to label them accordingly.
4. **Save Data**: Click "Save" to save the labeled data back to the original `.fson` file.
